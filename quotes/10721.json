      "quote": "I hate the word \"fate.\" Birth, encounters, partings, success and failures, fortune and misfortunes in life. If our lives are already set in stone by fate, then why are we even born? There are those born to wealthy families, those born to beautiful mothers, and those born into the middle of war or poverty. If that's all caused by fate, then God is incredibly unfair and cruel. Because, ever since that day, none of us had a future and the only certain thing was that we wouldn't amount to anything..."

      "quote": "As it turns out, living was a punishment. I've been punished in small doses, living as a Takakura. But, still, we were together. We took all the punishments, no matter how small and trivial. They're all precious memories. Because the only reason I felt alive was because you two were there."

      "quote": "Why are people born? If people are born only to suffer the hard life, is it meant as some kind of punishment? Or a cynical joke? If that's the case, animals that adhere to the survival strategies programmed in their DNA are far more elegant and simple. If there really is an existence worthy of being called a God, I want to ask him just one thing: Is there really fate in the universe? If a man ignored fate, and ignored his instincts and DNA to love someone else... Dear God, is he really human? Just wondering. I hate the word \"fate\"."

      "quote": "I love the word \"fate\". Because, you know how they talk about \"fated encounters\"? A single encounter can completely change your life. Such special encounters are not just coincidences. They're definitely... fate. Of course, life is not all happy encounters. There are many painful, sad moments. But this is what I think: sad and painful things definitely happen for a reason. Nothing in this world is pointless."

And stay there for the rest of their lives. And eventually, inside the box, they forget: what they looked like; what they loved; who they loved. That's why I'm getting out of my box. I'm one of the chosen. That's why I'm going to destroy this world."

To my surprise, she was the same kind of person as me, and she had the same kind of eyes, at first sight, I realized I wasn't a solitary existence in this world, I was so happy. That's right, until I met her, I was all alone in this world, I had not a soul with whom to share the scenery before my eyes, and not a soul with whom to share the music in my ears. But...I heard the voices all over the world, I could hear the whole world crying out, \"save me\". It's true, thus I could see the optimal path of the world. But it saddened me, because the moment I saw her - I knew we were never meant to be, yes, she refused to side with me. She rejected me - the only person who could see the same scenery."

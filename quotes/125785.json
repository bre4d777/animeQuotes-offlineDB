      "quote": "What is evil? Is it the bad side of society? Breaking the Law? Indeed, those are evil, but the true essence of \"evil\" is different.\nBoth justice and evil require you to carry out your own ego, in this there is no difference.\nIt's simply a question about the majority against minority.\nIn today's world, the majority follows the rules. That can't be helped.\nSo does that mean we, the minority, are wrong? No. Even if it means the entire world is our enemy, we persist. That is \"evil\"."

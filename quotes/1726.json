      "quote": "What would you ask for if you could have your wishes granted? Would you ask to be rich? Or to have the woman you're in love with be yours?  You can wish for whatever you want, it's your business, but to have one's wishes come true always comes with a price. Every deal has a catch. You'd better be nice and careful."

      "quote": "There are people out there who would say there's nothing more important than love. But is love really that great? There are women, who because of love, get chased around by men. And there are men, who because of love, get killed by women. To put it down, for love to be so great, there's gotta be something else behind it that's even greater."

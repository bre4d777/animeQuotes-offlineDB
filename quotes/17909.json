      "quote": "There are all sorts of goodbyes. There are sad goodbyes, and sometimes goodbyes you're thankful for, that take a load off your mind. It often happens that someone you say goodbye to unexpectedly returns, all self-conscious. Then there are times when, anticipating that, you put on the front of a short goodbye, only to have them not return so soon. And then there are goodbyes that last forever, true goodbyes that only happen once in your life."

      "quote": "When saying good-bye to this world, our great father split his blood into four: the eldest inherited only his sense of responsibility, the second eldest inherited only his easygoing personality, the youngest inherited only his innocence, and me, well, I inherited only his idiocy.  What held us diverse brothers together was the love of our mother, deeper than the sea, and the farewell we bid our great father.  Sometimes, one profound separation can unite the ones left behind."

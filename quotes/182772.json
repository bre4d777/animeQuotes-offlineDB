      "quote": "When I was little, I was teased because of my weight. I tried dieting, but diets always failed. Little by little I started feeling gloomy. I got to the point where I couldn't make friends, and I started hating myself more and more. I became completely unable to smile. I thought, no one in the world would ever like me the way I am now. But at the same time I also thought, if that's the way it is, then I should at least like myself."

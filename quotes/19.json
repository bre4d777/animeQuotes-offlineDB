Can you even begin to comprehend what happens when you awaken the monster inside each us? People should know in their hearts that food tastes good. They should always look forward to having picnics and wonderful places on their weekends. They should think that beer tastes good after a hard day's work. People should know how they should feel, that they're suppose to grieve, from the bottom of their hearts when they have to bury their own child."

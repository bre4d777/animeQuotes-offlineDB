      "quote": "Since I was a little girl, I acted before I spoke. Sometimes I inconvenienced those around me. I wasn't very good at expressing myself and was awkward... But that's when I found songs! Songs allow you to honestly convey your feelings. By singing, you can feel the same as others. By singing, you can connect with others. That's why I love songs. I love singing!"

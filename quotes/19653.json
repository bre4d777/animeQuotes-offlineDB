      "quote": "Without what you call absolute power, we'll be able to live free and strong... That's why I have to end this. Humans often betray, fight and do terrible things to each other, but if I can feel this heat and this pain in my heart, a future where everyone will be kind to each other will definitely come some day. I can believe in it now!"

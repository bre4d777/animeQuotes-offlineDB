What many people call \"\"trust\"\" is really just giving up on trying to understand others, and that very act is far worse than doubting. It is actually \"\"apathy\"\"."

      "quote": "The society you all live in has long since turned into the Liar Game. Still, what all of you demonstrated through this game is that 'Believing' is by no means, an easy path to follow. Sometimes, taking it means allowing yourself be deceived or suffering heavy damage you will not ever recover from. And yet, 'Trust' born when you forget your personal interests and join forces to fight against the odds together holds tremendous power."

However, there is something that outshines them all and provides a faster and more effective way to victory. And that is... information. The one in possession of information will be able to easily become the ruler of the liar game."

      "quote": "A former teacher of mine, Okabe-sensei, was always saying this to me: 'To believe people is to doubt them.'... meaning if you keep doubting people and searching what's inside them, sooner or later you're bound to understand something about them. And when you do, you'll be able to entrust something to them. That is what it means to trust and believe."

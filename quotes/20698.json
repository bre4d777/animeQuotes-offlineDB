I could analyze the mentality of the actions that were grounded on these abundant, repulsive emotions. That's because I had plenty of those ugly feelings inside of me. That's why it was simple to imagine. if they were similar things, then there was still room to understand it. I could explain using logic.\n\nHowever, if there wasn't, then it was difficult.\n\nWithout the concept of profit and loss, it was hard to imagine the feelings of people who went beyond people who went beyond logic and theory. I had too little to go on and above all else. I had committed too many mistakes up until now.\n\nGood will, friendship, or even love; they were all things I had been mistaken with. I was sure that I was mistaken with them even now as I thought about them."

Getting involved will hurt them, but trying not to get involved might hurt them too. But if it's someone you don't care about, you won't notice you've hurt them. What's important is your awareness of it. It's because you care about them, that you feel like you've hurt them. Caring about someone means being resolved to the fact that you'll hurt them. The more people care for each other, the farther out of reach certain things get. But that's not something to be sad about, I think it's probably something to be proud of."

If there's a time when those ill feelings surfaced, then there's also going to be a time where you restrained yourself, smiled, and then cut your relationships afterwards.\n\nBeing aware of your eventual break up was a rather complicated thing. If you wanted to graduate with a smile, shouldn't you avoid approaching your friends too much? And that's where having no friends was super convenient!"

      "quote": "To live is to undertake a journey - no, to undertake a journey is to live. To face the wind or to follow it, all journeys lead to the gates of death...

As long as it is a man and not a god, doing the governing, he can never be perfect. But should he neglect to make efforts to reach for perfection, a king will surely tumble down the slippery slope towards evil with no one around to stop him."

      "quote": "As you go through life, the might current of society is bound to get in your way and there will certainly be times that things don't go as you'd hoped. When this happens, don't look to society for a cause. Do not renounce society. Frankly, you'd be wasting your time. Instead just say, \"That's life!\" and muddle your way through with frustration. Once you're past it, consider: If society's swift current is tossing you around, how should you be swimming there in it's midst. You should have learned how, here in the E class, in this assassination classroom. You don't always have to stand and face it head-on. You can run and you can hide. If it's not against the rules, you can try a sneak attack. You can use unconventional weapons. Stay determined - not impatient nor discouraged - and with repeated trial and error, you're bound to reach a splendid outcome eventually."

Some of us went ballistic like we thought they would, some got all fired up for next time and some irresponsible- lookin' types turned out to be crazy serious. The guy we thought was just a little runt turned out to be a genius assassin, and a guy we thought was a genius was secretly workin' hard all along. With all these different skillsets...we just might be able to handle any challenge that comes our way."

      "quote": "I study too, you know. How could I teach anyone if I didn't grow and learn day by day. Now let's get rid of this dangerous cloth. Experiencing my Absolute Defense Form over summer vacation taught me yet another skill: compressing not my whole body, but a portion of my tentacles to release a burst of energy. Remember this Itona, I say assassination is education. The assassination classrooms teacher will get stronger every time he teaches!"

      "quote": "If that treetop is school, and the ground is this place here... we all found our strength down on the ground. While looking up... and getting looked down on... we learned plenty about how scary heights were before we started climbing. That's why we can go our own way now. Still... Somewhere along the way we forgot our fear of heights, so we do still fall to the ground every now and then. So learn here. You can go on to school once you have a game plan. That's my secret lesson, from me to you."

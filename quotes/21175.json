      "quote": "I am looking at things from a much higher perspective than you. I observe this world, this universe, the truth of all things. And I have come to realize that humanity must be destroyed. Out of all which the Gods have made, humans are their sole failure. They are a disease that must be vanquished. A filth that must be cleansed. They have no place here, in this universe, and if I am to make it a utopia once more, then I must take upon the grand task of removing humanity forever, in place of the Gods who refuse to admit their mistake."

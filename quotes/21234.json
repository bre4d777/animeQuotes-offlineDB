      "quote": "\"Believing in someone.\" That's a weird phrase, isn't it? After all, if you truly believed in a person, you wouldn't need to say, \"I believe you.\" It's like saying, \"I believe in air.\" I don't mean to say that \"believing in something\" is like a lie. \"Believing\" is really a term of hope of wanting to believe."

      "quote": "To get what you want, you put up with something, make an effort, learn a skill, and inspire yourself. Is that how it is with Hinazuki too? Right now... I can tell she's enduring something. Just the opposite of me, she is pretending to be indifferent. She pretends to feel nothing, but a 10 year old girl isn't that strong."

      "quote": "When I get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself, I want to go to a land thatâ€™s far away.\nI want to go to a faraway island. I want to go to an island that has no people. I want to go to an island that has no pain or sadness.\nThere are no adults, children, classmates, teachers or my mom on that island.\nOn that island, I can climb a tree when I want to climb, swim in the sea when I want to swim, and sleep when I want to sleep.\nIn the island, I think about the town that I left behind. Kids go to school, as if nothing has changed.\nAdults go to the office, as if nothing has changed. Mom eats, as if nothing has changed.\nWhen I think about the town without me, I feel a sense of relief. I want to go far, far away."

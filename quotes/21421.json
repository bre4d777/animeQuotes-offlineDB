      "quote": "It's because we don't unterstand! It's because we don't unterstand that we wonder what the other is thinking and try desperately to unterstand every word they say...

I believe you become friends with somebody by doing that over and over, and that's how... As much as I hate to admit it, it's how I became friends with these guys."

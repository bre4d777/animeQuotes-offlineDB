      "quote": "When I look up, I see a gloomy, cloudy sky. Today is another tiring uphill climb. I get sick of it all. Then... I think of the girl I love, and I put back on those worn down shoes. Her smile is like a ray of light that shines down from in between the clouds and warms up my heart. My girl has the smile of an angel."

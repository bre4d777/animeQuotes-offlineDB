      "quote": "The days I spent with you were a lot of fun. I realized for the first time that it makes me so happy to be needed by others. I thought I'd get along well with you like this. But I can't. I was being a jerk. While I was with you, I was looking at someone else. I kept it to myself even after realizing that. I was taking advantage of your kindness."

And every day there's bound to be something that makes us mad when there's nothing we can do to change the state of affairs. But that's not entirely true, either. We have to give these kinds of things some real thought as well. If we're sitting back and waiting for the future to arrive - we don't have anything invested in tomorrow. I don't want a tomorrow like that."

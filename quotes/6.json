If you lead such a busy life and you don't realize how your parents feel, it's only self-satisfaction. It's alright to stop every now and again, if you want a moment's rest, if you want to feel what other people feel."

Yes, tomorrow would be different. Hm. Tomorrow. As much as I wanted to believe, it only went from bad to worse. A vicious cycle... I didn't want other kids to grow up like me, so I started my own orphanage. It was gratifying work, I was actually doing something for the good of others.

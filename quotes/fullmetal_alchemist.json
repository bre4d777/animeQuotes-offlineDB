But on that night, I learned the value of some things can't be measured on a simple scale. My brother and I knew the laws of science, of Equivalent Exchange, that gain required sacrifice, that something had to be taken from us. But we thought there was nothing more we could lose.

They don't want anyone to worry about them. That's how they are. Even so, there may come a time when they'll ask for your help. And when they do, I know that you'll be there for them. Isn't that enough?"

However, the real world isnâ€™t perfect, so there is not just a single law that governs everything that happens within it. It is the same for the Law of Conservation in Alchemy. Even so, I believe that people cannot obtain something without paying a price. The pain we felt was surely enough of a price to pay. And anyone who pays the price known as hard work surely gains something. The Law of Conservation is not the law governing this \nworld. Until the day I meet with him again, that is the promiseâ€¦ Ni-san and I made."

      "quote": "Right now, we're all really only taking it day by day. Even if we can't get used to things, even if we can't win at something, even if we don't have any excess...In order to live day by day, we work, we fail, and we succeed. Sometimes we laugh. For the blessing before our very eyes, for our friends, we're thankful. Who knew that people could feel happiness just from living?"

      "quote": "I... the society I was in- says that if you don't have anything you want to do, then you're no good. That if you don't have dreams, you're no good. If you don't win, you're no good. If you can't get a nice life... if you can't accumulate a lot... then you aren't happy, they said. And yet... and yet, mom... I... I just wanted you to say that I'm fine how I am. That's all."

      "quote": "If all life is so important, then the most evil of all beings on this earth are without a doubt humans. If there weren't any people on earth, the environment and conditions that all living things live in would be drastically better. Even if there were no school to teach us the stuff we know, it would still be obvious to everyone, wouldn't it? Just think of all that's happened to the earth due to our desires and ego."

      "quote": "How can you work so hard? There might be something really bad waiting for you ahead. How can you still make yourself move on despite that? The older we get...the number of annoying and troublesome things we have to face only increases- and wonderful things stop happening. In the days ahead of us... we have to bear each painful thing one at a time, conquering them...overcoming them...the power to do that just doesn't spring out of me. The power to move ahead."
